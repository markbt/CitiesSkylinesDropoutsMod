# Cities: Skylines - Dropouts

A mod for [Cities: Skylines](http://www.citiesskylines.com/).

## What is it?

This mod makes some of your cims drop out of high school or university.
This means they remain at a lower education level.

This has two main effects:

- If your city operates at near full employment, industry that requires
  uneducated workers won't all be starved of employees.
- You'll need to make sure you provide enough work opportunities for
  everyone.
